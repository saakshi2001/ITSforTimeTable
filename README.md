# ITS for TimeTable
An algorithm based on a new approach called dynamic-time-quantum estimation intending to reduce the number of context switches among processes and offering optimal response time.
We can prove that the intelligent time slice is better and more effective than Round Robin.
Intelligence time slice (ITS) helps in providing the students with an efficient timetable where the courses have been prioritised with respect to their class duration and credits.
